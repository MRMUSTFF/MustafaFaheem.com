<p>There is only one man who can claim the top spot on this list, and that is the rookie of the year and World Championship MVP: Alexis “zen” Bernier. Following the expiration of his one year ban, the 16 year old prodigy joined Team Vitality at the beginning of the Spring split. He was the spark that caused Team Vitality to produce such incredible results last season, claiming the Spring Major Offensive MVP and the Spring Major and Worlds Overall MVP, solidifying himself as the greatest rookie of all time.</p>
