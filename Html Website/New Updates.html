Quality of Life Updates
New Minimum Level for Competitive Playlist 
Disabling “Leave Tournament” button at end of match
v2.35 prepares Rocket League for the Mandalorian Mayhem Limited Time Event 
2024 Esports Shop Refresh</li> 
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>CHANGES AND UPDATES</strong><br />
To ensure that players are spending a reasonable amount of time acclimating to Rocket League before jumping into the ranked experience, we changed the minimum level requirement for the Competitive Playlist to Level 20 (up from the previous level requirement of 10).
In addition, we have changed the design that previously allowed players to play ranked if they were partied with an individual above the minimum level requirement. Now, no player below the level threshold (20) will be able to enter the ranked experience.
Party leaders with a member below the level threshold will see their playlist locked and will need to queue in the Casual Playlist.</li> 
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>UPDATED MINIMUM LEVEL MESSAGING</strong><br />
To convey these new restrictions, players will see new messaging in Rocket League when queuing for the Competitive Playlist.
While solo (not in a party) the new messaging will read: “You must be Level 20 or higher.”
While in a party, the new messaging will read: “All party members must be Level 20 or higher.”
These messages will be displayed to any player who is below Level 20 / any party leader in a party with someone who is below Level 20.</li> 
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>DISABLING “LEAVE TOURNAMENT” BUTTON AT END OF MATCH</strong><br />
In order to prevent players from receiving negative consequences, such as temporary bans from tournaments/matchmaking, or losing earned tournament rewards, we will now grey out/disable the “Leave Tournament'' button at the 0:00 gameplay mark of Tournament matches.
This will ensure your rewards are earned and all data is properly populated so you can jump right into your next match.</li>
