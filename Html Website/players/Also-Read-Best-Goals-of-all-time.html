<header><h2>Best Rocket League Goals of all time</h2></header>
<p>At its heart, Rocket League is a relatively simple game, car football. However, having the ability to perform incredible aerial plays and freestyle-esque shots adds another element to the game. The combination has opened up a new esport where fans can see the best of the best playing at the top of their game.</p>
<p>With an ever growing skill ceiling, professional players are able to produce insane mechanical plays and score some of Rocket League’s best goals.</p>

<p>SquishyMuffinz and his teammates burst onto the scene in 2017 with an upset win at Dreamhack Atlanta. This was the first LAN win of many for the trio, who were later signed by Cloud9 just before the start of RLCS Season 4. They went on to win the regional championship, thus qualifying for Worlds as NA’s #1 seed.</p>
<p>Squishy had made a name for himself with his innovative mechanical plays, including never before seen moves from off the ceiling. But it wasn’t until the World Championship where he was able to finally pull one off successfully. Taking the ball up the wall and off the ceiling, Squishy was able to fake it under the first defender and by saving his flip he was able to hit it over the second. Nothing like this had ever been seen before in pro play, and to score it on LAN in the losers final shows how Squishy is one of the best Rocket League players of all time.</p>

<p>Throughout his career Deevo has been known for his clutch, unexpected double taps (earning himself the title: “the double tap king”), and this one at the Season 5 World Championships was by far the most impressive. In an intense round one match against NRG, Deevo produced one of the most insane plays that we have ever seen. By hitting the ball up into the corner of the ceiling, landing on the backboard and flipping into the ball as it drops down he stunned the defense and showed everyone he was still one of the best in the game after failing to qualify for the previous World Championships.</p>

<p>After all that they had achieved in the RLCS 21-22 season, his teammates and fans were left shocked when Vatira announced his decision to leave Moist Esports to join Karmine Corp in the off season. These events created a rivalry between the two teams in RLCS 22-23, a rivalry that was heavily dominated by Vatira and his teammates as they dominated Moist twice in online regional events leading up to the Fall Major.</p>
