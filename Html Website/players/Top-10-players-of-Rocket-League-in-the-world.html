<header><h2>Top 10 players of Rocket League in the world</h2></header>
<p>Zen has arguably the best mechanics in the world, but it was his ability to play such a smart and selfless role on top of this that allowed Team Vitality to dominate every team. Nobody expected him to play in such a mature and experienced manner, and this is what shocked everyone the most.</p>

<p>The fact that a single player has earned over $310,000 in only one half of a season is frankly remarkable, and I donâ€™t think we will ever see a performance from a rookie like this again.</p>

<p>zen quickly attained attention in an eleven-series 1v1 showmatch winstreak in February 2023[1]. Following the expiration of a one-year ban, the prodigy achieved a perfect sweep of the RLCS 2022-23 Spring Split, and concluded the debut season by winning the RLCS 2022-23 World Championship.</p>

<p>zen initially gained attention in 2021 and was seen as one of Europe's most promising upcoming players, set to become eligible to play in the RLCS in the 21-22 Spring Split - though the prodigy's RLCS debut would be delayed until 2023 as a result of a one-year ban, citing a breach of the code of conduct for illegally subbing in a qualifier in 2020 as an underage and unregistered player.</p>

<p>During the suspension, zen continued to draw attention throughout 2022 and early 2023, notably winning the Urban Series four times in a row[5]. Recognising talent, Team Vitality signed zen at the start of the RLCS 22-23 Season in October 2022[6], five months ahead of the expiration of the ban.</p>

<p>After the expiration of the suspension, zen was able to complete a sweep of the RLCS 2022-23 Spring Split, consisting of three regional tournaments and an international major - a world first accomplishment. zen finished the debut season by winning the RLCS 2022-23 World Championship, making Team Vitality the first ever organisation to win the world championship twice, as well as the highest earning organisation in the history of Rocket League.</p>
